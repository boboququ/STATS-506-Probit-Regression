###Stata
#### 1.Data Summary
Firstly, We import the Mroz data from website and show the first six rows of the dataset.
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Importing data 
import delimited https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/Mroz.csv, clear
save mroz,replace
use mroz,clear
*List the first six rows 
list if v1<=6
```

Then, We change all binary variables to be numeric, and we get a summary of the data. 
Our response is lfp and its mean is 0.57. The range of age is from 30 to 60. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Change variables with values yes/no to 1/0
gen lfpart =1 if lfp == "yes"
replace lfpart =0 if lfp == "no"
gen wifec =1 if wc == "yes"
replace wifec =0 if wc == "no"
gen husbc =1 if hc == "yes"
replace husbc =0 if hc == "no"
drop lfp wc hc
rename lfpart lfp
rename wifec wc
rename husbc hc
*Get the summary of the data
summ
```

#### 2.Fitting model by Probit Regression
Now, we fit our data by probit regression. lfp is the response and the remaining variables
are predictors. Looking at the p-values, all variables have highly significant, except k618 and hc.
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Fitting the data by probit regression
probit lfp k5 k618 age lwg inc i.wc i.hc
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output3.png?raw=true){width=500px}

We get a summary of the probit prediction from the fitted model, we get the smallest probability is  
0.005691 and the largest probability is 0.9745. The 50% percentile is 0.5782336, which is close to 
its mean we showed above. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Predicting the probability of labor-force  participation
predict prob_lfp
summ prob_lfp, detail
```

#### 3.Marginal effect
Now, we predict the data for groups defined by levels of categorical variables.
##### Group by hc
First, we make a table of frequently count of hc and lfp
we predict the lfp for two groups: hc=0 and hc=1, and we keep other 
variables at mean. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tab lfp hc
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output5.png?raw=true){width=500px}

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of hc
margins hc, atmeans
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output6.png?raw=true){width=500px}

The marginal probability of hc=1 (husband has attained college) is 0.59 and it slightly 
higher than the marginal probability of hc=0 (husband has not attained college),
which is 0.57. There is not obivious differnce. It is reasonable because the p-value of 
hc is very high. 

##### Group by wc

The table of frequently shows that when wc=0, the proportion of lfp is average, 
which is closed to 0.5. However, when wc=1, the proportion of lfp=1 is much higher.
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tab lfp wc
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output7.png?raw=true){width=500px}

we predict the lfp for two groups: wc=0 and wc=1, and we keep other variables at mean. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of wc
margins wc, atmeans
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output8.png?raw=true){width=500px}

The result shows that the marginal probability is 0.71 when wc=1 and the marginal 
probability is 0.52 when wc=0. The probability of participating labor-force is higher
when wife has attended college. We can say that wife's college attendance is an 
important predictor. 

We can go deeper on the predictor wc. We predict lfp for group by age and wc. Age is at
every 10 years of age from 30 to 60. Since the output of marginal function is long, we make 
a plot to visualize the output and it is easier to interpert. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of wc and age
margins, at(age=(30(10)60) wc=(0 1)) atmeans vsquish
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output10.png?raw=true){width=500px}
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output11.png?raw=true){width=500px}
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output9.png?raw=true){width=500px}

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
marginsplot
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/graph2.png?raw=true){width=500px}

From the marginal plot, we can conclude that when age is increasing, the probability 
is decreasing. Also, The probability of wc=1 is always higher than wx=0. At age 60, 
the variablity is the highest because the 95% confidence interval is the widest.

##### Group by k5

The table of frequently shows that the proportion of lfp is decreasing when k5 is 
increasing. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tab lfp k5
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output12.png?raw=true){width=500px}

we predict the lfp by k5= 0 1 2 3, and we keep other variables at mean. Also, we 
make a plot to visualize the data. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of k5
margins, at(k5=(0 1 2 3)) atmeans
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output13.png?raw=true){width=500px}
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output14.png?raw=true){width=500px}

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
marginsplot
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/graph1.png?raw=true){width=500px}

The output shows that when women do not have any children 5 years old or younger, 
the probability of participating labor-force is 0.66 which is higher than the average. 
However, after they had childrens, the probability of participating labor-force is 
decreasing. Therefore, we can conclude that k5 is a significant predictor.
