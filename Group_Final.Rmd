The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a basic understanding of Probit Regression and its implementation in R, Python, Stata, and SAS, using the "Female Labor Force Participation" data set.

##Model Introduction 

A probit regression is a version of the generalized linear model used to model dichotomous outcome variables. It uses the inverse standard normal distribution as a linear combination of the predictors. The binary outcome variable Y is assumed to have a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p (where the success probability is $p \in (0,1)$). Hence, the probit link function is $$probit(EY) = \Phi^{-1}(p_i) = \Phi^{-1}(P_i[Y=1]) = \sum_{k=0}^{k=n}\beta_kx_{ik}$$ where $$\Phi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\alpha+\beta X} exp(-\frac{1}{2}Z^2)dZ$$. 

##Dataset: Female Labor Participation

In this tutorial, we work on Mroz data set on female labor participation with 8 variables. The data covers a sample of 753 married white women aged between 30 and 60 collected in 1975. The original source for this data is Mroz, T.A. (1987). "[The sensitivity of an empirical model of married women's hours of work to economic and statistical assumptions](http://unionstats.gsu.edu/9220/Mroz_Econometrica_LaborSupply_1987.pdf)." *Econometrica* 55, 765-799. The subset of the original data set used in this study can be found [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html). The description of the variables can be found below. 

```{r ps3_q1_source, message = FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
source('./varsam.R')
```

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cols = c('Variable(s)', 'Description', 'Type')
knitr::kable(var_sum, col.names = cols)
```

The goal of the tutorial is to identify whether certain characteristics of a woman's household and personal life can predict her labor-force participation. 

##Languages {.tabset}

###R

#### 1. Data Summary

First, we load data into R by using read.csv given that the data is in a comma-separated format.

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
mroz = read.csv('./mroz.csv')
```

This is what the first six rows look like in R:
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
head(mroz)
```

Then, we change all binary variables to be numeric. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
mroz$lfp = ifelse(mroz$lfp=="yes", 1, 0)
mroz$wc = ifelse(mroz$wc=="yes", 1, 0)
mroz$hc = ifelse(mroz$hc=="yes", 1, 0)
```

Here is the quick summary of the data. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
summary(mroz)
```

#### 2. Fitting model by Probit Regression

Next, we run a probit regression using lfp as a response variable and all the remaining variables as predictors. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
mroz.probit <- glm(lfp ~ k5 + k618 + age + wc + hc + lwg + inc, 
                  data = mroz,
                  family = binomial(link = "probit"))
summary(mroz.probit)
```

All of the coefficients, except for k618 and hc, are statistically significant. 

We can also obtain confidence intervals for the coefficient estimates.

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
confint(mroz.probit)
```

#### 3. Marginal effect

We first make a cross-tab of categorical predictors with our binary response variable and calculate adjusted predictions of lfp for two levels of hc and wc variables. 

##### Group by hc

We start by tabulating lfp and hc. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
addmargins(table(mroz$lfp, mroz$hc, deparse.level=2))
```

Then, we calculate the adjusted predictions of lfp for the two levels of hc variable. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
hc_data0 = data.frame(k5 = mean(mroz$k5), k618 = mean(mroz$k618), age=mean(mroz$age), 
                      lwg= mean(mroz$lwg), inc=mean(mroz$inc), hc=0, wc=mean(mroz$wc))
hc_data1 = data.frame(k5 = mean(mroz$k5), k618 = mean(mroz$k618), age=mean(mroz$age), 
                      lwg= mean(mroz$lwg), inc=mean(mroz$inc), hc=1, wc=mean(mroz$wc))

h0 = predict(mroz.probit, hc_data0, type="response", se=TRUE)
h1 = predict(mroz.probit, hc_data1, type="response", se=TRUE)

hc_fit = data.frame(Margin = c(h0$fit[1], h1$fit[1]), se=c(h0$se.fit[1], h1$se.fit[1]))
hc_fit
```

The marginal probability of husband being a college graduate is is 0.59, while the marginal probability of husband being a high school graduate is slightly lower at 0.57.

##### Group by wc

Here is the tabulation of lfp and wc. As can be seen below, there is a significant imbalance between labor force participation, when the women are college graduates. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
addmargins(table(mroz$lfp, mroz$wc, deparse.level=2))
```

We also calculate the adjusted predictions of lfp for the two levels of wc variable, while keeping other variables at mean. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
wc_data0 = data.frame(k5 = mean(mroz$k5), k618 = mean(mroz$k618), age=mean(mroz$age), 
                      lwg= mean(mroz$lwg), inc=mean(mroz$inc), hc = mean(mroz$hc), wc=0)
wc_data1 = data.frame(k5 = mean(mroz$k5), k618 = mean(mroz$k618), age=mean(mroz$age), 
                      lwg= mean(mroz$lwg), inc=mean(mroz$inc), hc = mean(mroz$hc), wc=1)

w0 = predict(mroz.probit, wc_data0, type="response", se=TRUE)
w1 = predict(mroz.probit, wc_data1, type="response", se=TRUE)

wc_fit = data.frame(Margin = c(w0$fit[1], w1$fit[1]), se=c(w0$se.fit[1], w1$se.fit[1]))
wc_fit
```

The marginal probability increases from 0.524 to 0.708 when women are college graduates vs. only high-school graduates. 

##### Group by age and wc

We can predict the outcome variable by both age and women's college education. We will use increments of 10 between 30 and 60 as representative ages. As the results show, the older a woman gets, the less are her chances of participating in the labor force. Regardless of age, women's college education always yields a higher probability of labor force participation.  

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
wc_data0_age=data.frame(k5=rep(mean(mroz$k5), 4), k618=rep(mean(mroz$k618), 4), 
                        age=c(30, 40, 50, 60), lwg=rep(mean(mroz$lwg), 4), 
                        inc=rep(mean(mroz$inc), 4), wc=rep(0, 4), 
                        hc=rep(mean(mroz$hc), 4))

wc_data1_age=data.frame(k5=rep(mean(mroz$k5), 4), k618=rep(mean(mroz$k618), 4), 
                        age=c(30, 40, 50, 60), lwg=rep(mean(mroz$lwg), 4), 
                        inc=rep(mean(mroz$inc), 4), wc=rep(1, 4), 
                        hc=rep(mean(mroz$hc), 4))

m0=predict(mroz.probit, wc_data0_age, type="response", se=TRUE)
m1=predict(mroz.probit, wc_data1_age, type="response", se=TRUE)

wc_fit_age = data.frame(Margin_wc0=m0$fit, Margin_wc1=m1$fit, se_wc0=m0$se.fit, se_wc1=m1$se.fit)
wc_fit_age
```

##### Group by k5

Below is a cross-tab of lfp with k5. The tabulation shows that the more the number of kids aged below 6 years, the less women participate in the labor force. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
addmargins(table(mroz$lfp, mroz$k5, deparse.level=2))
```

We can predict lfp at different levels of k5, by keeping other variables at mean. When k5=0, the marginal probability of a woman's participation in the labor force is 0.657, whereas when they have three or more, the probability is at around 0.013. This range is a good indicator of the significance of k5 variable. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
k_data=data.frame(k5=c(0,1,2,3), k618=rep(mean(mroz$k618), 4), age=rep(mean(mroz$age), 4), 
                  lwg=rep(mean(mroz$lwg), 4), inc=rep(mean(mroz$inc), 4), 
                  wc = rep(mean(mroz$wc), 4), hc=rep(mean(mroz$hc), 4))

k0=predict(mroz.probit, k_data, type="response", se=TRUE)

k_fit = data.frame(Margin_k=k0$fit, se_k=k0$se.fit)
k_fit
```

###Python

####Data Summary

First we start by loading the data into memory using the pandas package. The data is read in as a pandas dataframe, which is very similar to a R dataframe.

We also load numpy for array manipulation and we will be using the statsmodel package for Probit regression.

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import Probit

data = pd.read_csv('https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/Mroz.csv')
```

To print the first few rows of the data, we use the head function. This is similar to other languages such as R. 

```
print(data.head())

```

```

   Unnamed: 0  lfp  k5  k618  age   wc  hc       lwg        inc
0           1  yes   1     0   32   no  no  1.210165  10.910001
1           2  yes   0     2   30   no  no  0.328504  19.500000
2           3  yes   1     3   35   no  no  1.514128  12.039999
3           4  yes   0     3   34   no  no  0.092115   6.800000
4           5  yes   1     2   31  yes  no  1.524280  20.100000


```
####Data Cleaning

Since some of the data is read in as strings, we need to transform them into binary categorical data using the following code. We also drop the first column as it is read in with row numbers, which we do not need.

```
data = data.drop(data.columns[0], axis = 1)

data["lfp"] = data["lfp"] == "yes"
data["wc"] = data["wc"] == "yes"
data["hc"] = data["hc"] == "yes"

```

Looking at the data again we see:

```

    lfp  k5  k618  age     wc     hc       lwg        inc
0  True   1     0   32  False  False  1.210165  10.910001
1  True   0     2   30  False  False  0.328504  19.500000
2  True   1     3   35  False  False  1.514128  12.039999
3  True   0     3   34  False  False  0.092115   6.800000
4  True   1     2   31   True  False  1.524280  20.100000


```

####Summary Statistics

Before we begin our analysis here is a quick summary of the data. We use the function describe on our dataframe to generate some summary statistics.

```
print(data.describe())

```

This generates summary statistics for the continuous variables in our dataset. 

```
               k5        k618         age         lwg         inc

```


####Fitting Probit Regression


First we break our dataset into response variable and predictor variables. We will use lfp as our response variable and all the remaining variable as predictors. Then we use the statsmodels function to fit our Probit regression with our response variable and design matrix. The statsmodels package is unique from other languages and packages as it does not include an intercept term by default. This needs to be manually set. 


```
Y = data["lfp"]
X = data.drop(["lfp"], 1)
X = sm.add_constant(X)

model = Probit(Y, X.astype(float))
probit_model = model.fit()
print(probit_model.summary())

```

The following is the results of our regression. The statsmodels package automatically includes p values and confidence intervals for each coefficient. For those that are familiar with objects, the probit model is stored as a probit model object in Python. All operations with the model are invoked as model.member_function().

==============================================================================

```
It appears that all our predictors are statistically significant at level a except hc and k618. 

####Marginal Effects

To better understand why our predictors are significant, we attempt to study the marginal effects of our predictors. In this section, we will look at the predictors hc, wc, age, and k5. Unfortunately, there is no member function of the probit class to calculate the standard error of each prediction so this is ommited in this version. 

#####Group by Husband's College Attendance

First we group the data by hc. 

To better understand hc, we tabulate lfp and hc. This is done with the pandas crosstab function. 
```
print(pd.crosstab(data["lfp"], data["hc"], margins = True))
```

```
hc     False  True  All
lfp                    
False    207   118  325
True     251   177  428
All      458   295  753
```

Then we calculate adjusted predictions of lfp for two levels of the hc variable. Creating these adjusted predictors is not very clean in Python compared to other languages. We have to build the array from scratch.

```
hc_data0 = np.column_stack((
	1,
	np.mean(data["k5"]),
	np.mean(data["k618"]),
	np.mean(data["age"]),
	np.mean(data["wc"]),
	0,
	np.mean(data["lwg"]),
	np.mean(data["inc"])
	))
	
	hc_data1 = np.column_stack((
	1,
	np.mean(data["k5"]),
	np.mean(data["k618"]),
	np.mean(data["age"]),
	np.mean(data["wc"]),
	1,
	np.mean(data["lwg"]),
	np.mean(data["inc"])
	))
```

The results of running this prediction is as follows. 

```
print(probit_model.predict(hc_data0))
print(probit_model.predict(hc_data1))

```


```
[ 0.56938181]
[ 0.59171968]

```

We see that the marginal probability of husband being a collage graduate is 0.59, while the marginal probability of husband being a high school graduate is lower at 0.57.


#####Group by Wife's College Attendance

Similarly to hc, we tabulate our response variable lfp and predictor wc. We can see that there is a significant imbalance between labor force participation for women that are college graduates.
```
print(pd.crosstab(data["lfp"], data["wc"], margins = True))
```

```
wc     False  True  All
lfp                    
False    257    68  325
True     284   144  428
All      541   212  753
```

We also calculate the adjusted predictions of lfp for the two levels of wc variable, while keeping other variables at the mean. 

```

wc_data0 = np.column_stack((
	1,
	np.mean(data["k5"]),
	np.mean(data["k618"]),
	np.mean(data["age"]),
	0,
	np.mean(data["hc"]),
	np.mean(data["lwg"]),
	np.mean(data["inc"])
	))

wc_data1 = np.column_stack((
	1,
	np.mean(data["k5"]),
	np.mean(data["k618"]),
	np.mean(data["age"]),
	1,
	np.mean(data["hc"]),
	np.mean(data["lwg"]),
	np.mean(data["inc"])
	))


```

The result of running this prediction is as follows:


```
print(probit_model.predict(wc_data0))
print(probit_model.predict(wc_data1))
```

```
[ 0.52380974]
[ 0.70816505]
```

It appears that the marginal probability increases from 0.524 to 0.708 when women are college graduates compared to highschool graduates. 

#####Group by Age and Wife's College Attendance

We can predict the outcome variable by both age and women's college education. We use increments of 10 between 30 and 60 as our representative ages. 

```
wc_data0 = np.column_stack((
	np.repeat(1,4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["k5"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["k618"]), 4),
	(30,40,50,60),
	np.repeat(0,4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["hc"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["lwg"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["inc"]),4)
	))

wc_data1 = np.column_stack((
	np.repeat(1,4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["k5"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["k618"]), 4),
	(30,40,50,60),
	np.repeat(1,4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["hc"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["lwg"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["inc"]),4)
))
```
The results of running the prediction is as follows:
```
print(probit_model.predict(wc_data0))
print(probit_model.predict(wc_data1))
```
```
[ 0.70330952  0.5618684   0.41195181  0.27399923]
[ 0.84667045  0.74021954  0.6047985   0.45523423]
```

As we can see, the older a women gets, the less chance of her participating in the labor force. Regardless of age, women's college education always yields a higher probability of labor force participation.


#####Group by Number of Children 5 years or younger (K5)

Finally we look at the effects of number of children 5 years or younger. As before, here is a cross tabulation of this variable. 

```
print(pd.crosstab(data["lfp"], data["k5"], margins = True))
```
```
k5       0    1   2  3  All
lfp                        
False  231   72  19  3  325
True   375   46   7  0  428
All    606  118  26  3  753
```

Then we predict lfp at different levels of k5, while keeping other variables at their means. 

```
k5_data = np.column_stack((
	np.repeat(1,4),
	(0,1,2,3),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["k618"]), 4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["age"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["wc"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["hc"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["lwg"]),4),
	np.repeat(np.mean(data["inc"]),4)
	))
	
	print(probit_model.predict(k5_data))

```

```
[ 0.65730924  0.31932735  0.08942703  0.01324326]
```

We see that if there are three or more children under the age of 5, there is a 0.013 chance of a woman being in the work force, but when there is no children there is a 0.6573 chance. This is a good indication of the significance of this variable. 

#####Extension

Finally, an overall marginal effect can be observed by calling the get_margeff() method of the probit model class. This is unique to Python. Results are as follows.


```
mfx = probit_model.get_margeff()
print(mfx.summary())
```
```

###Stata

#### 1.Data Summary

Firstly, we import the Mroz data from the website and show the first six rows of the dataset.

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Importing data 
import delimited https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/Mroz.csv, clear
save mroz,replace
use mroz,clear
*List the first six rows 
list if v1<=6
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output1.png?raw=true){width=500px}

Then, we change all binary variables to be numeric, and we get a summary of the data. 
Our response is lfp and its mean is 0.57. The range of age is from 30 to 60. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Change variables with values yes/no to 1/0
gen lfpart =1 if lfp == "yes"
replace lfpart =0 if lfp == "no"
gen wifec =1 if wc == "yes"
replace wifec =0 if wc == "no"
gen husbc =1 if hc == "yes"
replace husbc =0 if hc == "no"
drop lfp wc hc
rename lfpart lfp
rename wifec wc
rename husbc hc
*Get the summary of the data
summ
```

#### 2.Fitting model by Probit Regression

Now, we fit our data by probit regression. lfp is the response and the remaining variables
are predictors. Looking at the p-values, all variables have high sigificance, except k618 and hc.

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Fitting the data by probit regression
probit lfp k5 k618 age lwg inc i.wc i.hc
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output3.png?raw=true){width=500px}

We get a summary of the probit prediction from the fitted model, we get that the smallest probability is  
0.005691 and the largest probability is 0.9745. The 50% percentile is 0.5782336, which is close to 
its mean shown above. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*Predicting the probability of labor-force  participation
predict prob_lfp
summ prob_lfp, detail
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output4.png?raw=true){width=500px}


#### 3.Marginal effect

Now, we predict the data for groups defined by levels of categorical variables.

##### Group by hc

First, we make a table of frequency counts of hc and lfp and
we predict the lfp for two groups: hc=0 and hc=1, while keeping other 
variables at mean. 
```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tab lfp hc
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output5.png?raw=true){width=500px}

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of hc
margins hc, atmeans
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output6.png?raw=true){width=500px}

The marginal probability of hc=1 (husband has attained college) is 0.59 and it slightly 
higher than the marginal probability of hc=0 (husband has not attained college),
which is 0.57. There is not an obivious differnce. It is reasonable because the p-value of 
hc is very high. 

##### Group by wc

The table of frequency shows that when wc=0, the proportion of lfp is average, 
which is close to 0.5. However, when wc=1, the proportion of lfp=1 is much higher.

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tab lfp wc
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output7.png?raw=true){width=500px}

We predict the lfp for two groups: wc=0 and wc=1, and we keep other variables at mean. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of wc
margins wc, atmeans
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output8.png?raw=true){width=500px}

The result shows that the marginal probability is 0.71 when wc=1, and the marginal 
probability is 0.52 when wc=0. The probability of participating in the labor-force is higher
when wife has attended college. We can say that wife's college attendance is an 
important predictor. 

We can go deeper on the predictor wc. We predict lfp for group by age and wc. Age is at
every 10 years of age from 30 to 60. Since the output of marginal function is long, we make 
a plot to visualize the output and it is easier to interpert. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of wc and age
margins, at(age=(30(10)60) wc=(0 1)) atmeans vsquish
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output10.png?raw=true){width=500px}
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output11.png?raw=true){width=500px}
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output9.png?raw=true){width=500px}

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
marginsplot
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/graph2.png?raw=true){width=500px}

From the marginal plot, we can conclude that when age is increasing, the probability 
is decreasing. Also, The probability of wc=1 is always higher than wc=0. At age 60, 
the variablity is the highest because the 95% confidence interval is the widest.

##### Group by k5

The table of frequency shows that the proportion of lfp is decreasing when k5 is 
increasing. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tab lfp k5
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output12.png?raw=true){width=500px}

We predict the lfp by k5= 0 1 2 3, and we keep other variables at mean. Also, we 
make a plot to visualize the data. 

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
*use margins for each level of k5
margins, at(k5=(0 1 2 3)) atmeans
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output13.png?raw=true){width=500px}
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/output_screenshots/output14.png?raw=true){width=500px}

```{r, error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
marginsplot
```
![](https://github.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/blob/talibova-patch-1/Stata/graph1.png?raw=true){width=500px}

The output shows that when women do not have any children 5 years old or younger, 
the probability of participating in the labor-force is 0.66 which is higher than the average. 
However, after they had children, the probability of participating in the labor-force is 
decreasing. Therefore, we can conclude that k5 is a significant predictor.

Now, we fit our data by probit regression. lfp is the response and the remaining variables
are predictors. By adding argument "descending", we would be able to model 1s rather than 0s, which means predicting the probability of woman getting into label force (lfp=1) versus not getting in (lfp=0).

Here are the results we get from the regression:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/master/SAS/sas_outs/sas_out4-2.png){width=500px}
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/master/SAS/sas_outs/sas_out4-3.png){width=500px}
The result of the Global Null Hypothesis (by Likelihood Ratio, Score and Wald test) indicates that the model is statistically significant. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/master/SAS/sas_outs/sas_out5-1.png){width=500px}
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boboququ/STATS-506-Probit-Regression/master/SAS/sas_outs/sas_out5-2.png){width=500px}

As for each variable in the model, it is shown by the above two tables that: variable k618 and hc both have p-value greater than 0.05, thus under significant level alpha being 0.05, they are not statistically significant. The reason for k618 might be that kids of 6-18 are much more independent than kids less than 6, and their mom could have time to work. Regarding hc, whether husband has attended college won’t really affect their wife’s decision on whether being in the labor force or not.

Detailed Interpretations:
(Definition of z-score: the probit regression coefficients give the change in the probit index, also called a z-score, for a one unit increase in the predictor variable.)
•	k5: For each one more kid less than 6 years old, the z-score decreases by 0.8747.
•	k618: For each one more kid of 6-18 years old, the z-score decreases by 0.0386.
•	age: For one year increase in a woman’s age, the z-score decreases by 0.0378.
•	lwg: For a one unit increase in log(wage), the z-score increases by 0.3656.
•	inc: For a one unit increase in (family income – wage*hours)/1000, the z-score decreases by 0.0205.
•	wc: Wife having attended college would increases the z-score by 0.4883.
•	hc: Husband having attended college would increases the z-score by 0.0572.
